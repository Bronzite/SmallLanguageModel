# Small Language Models

This library is also intended to serve as a teaching and demonstration tool for
people entering into the language model space after the ChatGPT release.  An
understanding of large language models may be easeier to obtain by starting
with older, smaller language models to understand the strengths and limitation
of the class, as opposed to the limitations of the technology.
